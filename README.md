# Medicine-Alternatives-Finder
🎯Aim of the Project: 
To develop a GUI-based system that helps users find affordable alternative medicines by searching either by medicine name or by chemical composition, using a structured CSV database and prioritizing cost-effective options.

## 🚀 Features
- Search by **medicine name** or **chemical composition**
- Finds and displays **alternative drugs** with the **same chemical makeup**
- Sorts and shows alternatives by **lowest price first**
- Easy-to-use GUI using **Tkinter**
- Data stored in simple **CSV files** (lightweight, editable)

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **CSV** for backend data

## 🧠 How it Works
1. User selects search type (medicine or composition)
2. App loads relevant CSV data
3. Shows dynamic suggestions as you type
4. Displays sorted, cheaper alternatives

## 🔍 Sample Use Case
- A pharmacist wants to find cheaper alternatives to a branded medicine.
- A user can’t afford a specific medicine but needs one with the same composition.

## 🌟 Why this Project?
- Many people in India rely on **out-of-pocket healthcare**.
- Price awareness in medicine choices can significantly reduce treatment costs.
- Aimed to bridge the gap between affordability and accessibility.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real-time API data** from pharmacies
- Add **dosage/form filters** (tablet/syrup)
- Export suggestions to PDF
- Add **speech-to-text** search for accessibility
